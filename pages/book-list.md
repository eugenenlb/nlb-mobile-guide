<div class="new-accordion-content">
  <p>NLB Mobile and Libby are apps that let you borrow and read NLB's eBooks and audiobooks.</p>
<p><strong>NLB Mobile</strong> lets you easily check your account and access our resources. You can borrow eBooks / Audiobooks, access eNewspapers / eMagazines and online courses. </p><p>While NLB Mobile lets you read or listen to eBooks / Audiobooks while you are connected to the Internet, it does not have an in-built reader for you to read downloaded eBooks.</p>
<p><strong>Libby </strong>is a third-party app by OverDrive, a global distributor of content for libraries and schools. You can borrow and download NLB's eBooks / Audiobooks, so that you can enjoy them even when you are offline. <a href="https://help.libbyapp.com/6103.htm?tocpath=Home%7CGetting%20started%7C_____2">Watch a short introduction video on how to set up Libby</a>.</p>
