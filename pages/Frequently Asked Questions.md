Most patrons are currently receiving regular updates and notifications about NLB’s  programmes and initiatives through its Mobile App. As such, NLB will stop sending out SMS notices and reminders (except OTP) from **6 February 2023**.

We understand some patrons may still be receiving alerts through SMS, and we wish to encourage them tap on the NLB Mobile app as a one-stop portal for a fuller suite of services. Through the NLB Mobile App, they can find a host of library-related activities such as searching and browsing of NLB collections, borrowing books and other items, receive notices and reminders, and pay outstanding charges conveniently and securely.</p>
