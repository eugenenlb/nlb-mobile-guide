      	<p>Udemy Business is an online learning platform that offers thousands of courses on key soft skills and technical topics such as Software Development, Leadership, Marketing, Sales, Programming, IT, and more. Through the National Library Board (NLB), users have access to over 13,000 courses.
</p>

        <label for="acc2">What is the difference between Udemy Business and Udemy.com (individual subscription)?</label>
<div class="new-accordion-content">
        <p>NLB’s subscription is to Udemy Business. The main difference between Udemy Business vs the Udemy.com (individual subscription) is that Udemy Business is selectively curated by Udemy’s curation team with selection criteria such as high learner satisfaction, instructor reputation, and market demand i.e. courses with high ratings in the Udemy.com Marketplace. </p>

<p>Courses that do not meet the Udemy curation team’s selection criteria will not be included in NLB’s Udemy Business.
