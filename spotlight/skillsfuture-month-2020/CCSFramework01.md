<p>Change is happening at a groundbreaking rate. Organisations have had to pivot to new ways of conducting businesses and critical thinking skills are often crucial to problem solving and decision making. Take a page (or several pages) from the following recommended books and resources, and learn how leaders navigate through challenges facing their businesses.</p>


<h4>Articles</h4>

<h5>1. <a href="https://jamesclear.com/decision-making">The Decision Making Guide: How to Make Smart Decisions and Avoid Bad Ones</a><br/>
<i>James Clear.</i> Published on JamesClear.com.</h5>
<p>In this compilation of recommended resources on decision making, James Clear (author of Atomic Habits) explains decision making and provides possible reasons for why we sometimes make poor decisions. Included are books by authors such as Daniel Kahneman (Thinking, Fast and Slow), mental models from Elon Musk, and numerous past articles he has written. With these resources, readers are encouraged to develop their own mental concepts and look at problems through a different perspective.</p>

<h5>2. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/01/21/the-art-of-decision-making">The Art of Decision-Making</a><br/>
<i>Joshua Rothman.</i> Published on Recruiterbox on 21 Jan 2019.</h5>
<p>Joshua Rothman presents various concepts in the philosophy of decision making, and explores the influences on how decisions are made, while using his personal experiences to illustrate these concepts.</p>

<h5>3. <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/02/human-decision-making/">How People Make Decisions</a><br/>
<i>Susan Weinschenk.</i> Published on Smashing Magazine, on 7 Feb 2019.</h5>
<p>Behavioural scientist Susan Weinschenk explains how decision making is closely affected by emotions, and how we can shape our customers’ decision making process by first understanding the impetus for their decisions. She also shares a tip on giving fewer choices to help with decision making.</p>

<h5>4. <a href="https://www.thriveyard.com/19-ways-to-improve-your-problem-solving-skills-at-work/">19 Ways to Improve Your Problem Solving Skills at Work</a><br/>
<i>Duncan Muguku.</i> Published on ThriveYard on 14 May 2020.</h5>

<i>University of Jyväskylä.</i> Published on Phys.org on 19 Mar 2020.</h5>
<p>This article discusses the findings by the University of Jyväskylä, Department of Education on problem solving. It is found that creativity is a crucial element to effective problem solving, and its importance is highlighted throughout the article. A given example is software development - if a problem can be solved by a newly written code that is only understood by experts, it is not a good solution. Writing an elegant code which other people can also understand, will require creative thinking.</p>

<p>A dangerous myth about creativity is that “you either have it or you don’t.” While some people may be more talented than others, the ability to think and solve problems creatively is inherently wired into the human brain. As creatures of habit however, it’s easy to get “locked in” to processes that no longer serve us. Building on insights from improv, design thinking, comedy writing, and startup incubation, this course offers concrete tools for creative thinking.</p>
