<i>James Clear.</i> Published on JamesClear.com.</h5>
<p>James Clear, author of Atomic Habits, explains decision making, and provides possible reasons for why we sometimes make poor decisions. He as also compiled a collection of recommended resources pertaining to the subject of decision making, such as books written by authors such as Daniel Kahneman (Thinking, Fast and Slow), mental models from Elon Musk, as well as numerous past articles he has written. This article hopes to help readers develop their own mental concepts and look at problems through a different perspective.</p>

<h5>2. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/01/21/the-art-of-decision-making">The Art of Decision-Making</a><br/>
<i>Joshua Rothman.</i> Published on Recruiterbox on 21 Jan 2019.</h5>
<p>Joshua Rothman presents various concepts in the philosophy of decision making, and explores the influences on how decisions are made, while using his personal experiences to illustrate these concepts.</p>

<h5>3. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/ambigamy/202005/explaining-the-narcissistic-critical-thinkers-in-your-life">Explaining the Narcissistic “Critical Thinkers" in Your Life</a><br/>
<i>Jeremy E. Sherman Ph.D., MPP.</i> Published on Psychology Today on 1 May 2020.</h5>
<p>Jeremy E. Sherman, biophilosopher and social science researcher, points out the fallacies of self-proclaimed critical thinkers; people who are quick to single out people who seemingly “failed” at critical thinking, but will not tolerate any criticisms of their beliefs. He explains to readers on how such narcissitic critical thinkers often fall to the fallacies they claim to have conquered, and provides recommendations on how to practise responsible critical thinking.</p>

<i>Duncan Muguku.</i> Published on ThriveYard on 14 May 2020.</h5>

<h5>5. <a href="https://phys.org/news/2020-03-importance-creative-problem-solving-workplace.html">The importance of creative problem-solving in the workplace</a><br/>
<i>University of Jyväskylä.</i> Published on Phys.org on 19 Mar 2020.</h5>
<p>This article discusses the findings by the University of Jyväskylä, Department of Education on problem solving. It is found that creativity is a crucial element to effective problem solving, and its importance is highlighted through the article. For example, in software development, a problem can be solved by a newly written code, but if it can only be comprehended by experts, it is not a good solution. Writing an elegant code which is understandable by other people (clients, colleagues) other than the experts writing it will require creative thinking process.</p>

<p>A dangerous myth about creativity is that “you either have it or you don’t.” While some people may be more talented than others, the ability to think and solve problems creatively is inherently wired into the human brain. As creatures of habit however, it’s easy to get “locked in” to processes that no longer serve us.
